Nicolas Aponte here with my assignment 3 submission. I have properly commented all files involved, gave PRE/POST of each function, and tested all required functions and left the main.cpp easily editable. The first part is labeled with mainqueue.cpp and queue.h, with assignment code proof.png being the matching image. The part 2 question is labeled under the name of lin_search.h, lin_main.cpp, and lin_searchtest.png, so all relating files are there. Finally, Q3 is labeled a3q3main.cpp, insert_sort.h and q3q3proof.png being the image proof.  Please let me know if any changes are needed, and thank you!
